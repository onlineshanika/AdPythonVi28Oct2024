Assignment: Database and Table Creation with Data Insertion in Python
Objective: In this assignment, you will create a new MySQL database called school_db with a table called students. The table will store data about students, including their student_id (int), name (varchar), age (int), and grade (varchar). You will then use Python to connect to the database, insert some sample data, and retrieve it.

Instructions
Create the Database and Table in MySQL

Run the following SQL script in your MySQL environment to create the school_db database and the students table.


-- Step 1: Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE school_db;

-- Step 2: Use the created database
USE school_db;

-- Step 3: Create the students table
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT,
    grade VARCHAR(10)
);

Insert Sample Data into the Table

After creating the database and table, run the following SQL script to insert sample data into the students table.

-- Insert sample records into students table
INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age, grade) VALUES (1, 'Alice Johnson', 15, '10th');
INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age, grade) VALUES (2, 'Bob Smith', 16, '11th');
INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age, grade) VALUES (3, 'Carol White', 15, '10th');
INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age, grade) VALUES (4, 'David Brown', 17, '12th');
Python Code for Database Operations

Use the following Python script to connect to the school_db database, retrieve data from the students table, and display the results.
